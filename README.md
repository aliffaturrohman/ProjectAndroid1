# About Page Flutter Project

This Flutter project demonstrates creating a simple "About" page with various components, including a profile section, fun facts, a navigation drawer, and a bottom navigation bar. It uses `MaterialApp` as the main widget and leverages `Scaffold`, `Drawer`, and `BottomNavigationBar` for layout organization.

## Features

- **Profile Section**:
  - Includes a profile picture displayed as a circular avatar.
  - Displays personal information such as name, student ID, and class using the `ProfileList` widget.
- **Fun Fact Section**: A list of fun facts shown within a decorated container with a box shadow for a subtle 3D effect.
- **Floating Action Button**: A circular button at the bottom right with a plus icon, which can be used for additional actions.
- **Navigation Drawer**:
  - Contains a header displaying the userâ€™s account information.
  - Includes "Settings" and "Log Out" options with icons.
- **Bottom Navigation Bar**:
  - Provides navigation options for "Home," "Search," and "About" pages.
  - Highlights the "About" icon by default.
